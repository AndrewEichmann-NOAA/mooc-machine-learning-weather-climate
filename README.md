# MOOC Machine Learning in Weather & Climate - Jupyter notebook exercises

This repository hosts the Jupyter notebook based exercises of the Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) on Machine Learning in Weather & Climate https://www.ecmwf.int/mlwc-mooc.

The notebooks can either be downloaded and run on participants' own computers, or they can be run directly in various cloud environments. The advantage of the latter is that no software needs to be installed locally.
